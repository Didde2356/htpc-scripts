rcmkb
=====

Mouse support implemented in a very small python script, using the XTEST extension. A better reimplementation of lircmd.

Features:

- Mouse wheel support!
- Configurable acceleration up to a limit
- Support for small, medium and large mouse movements - provided you have the buttons available on your mouse
- More configurable than lircmd

Set up your buttons in rcmkb_lircrc, configure any settings you want to tweak at the top of the script and run
